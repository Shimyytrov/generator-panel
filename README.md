# Shimyytrov's Generator Panel
 A game by Shimyytrov Studio.
 
 ## The very first project by a new team
This is a simple game. You need to control a panel of two generators to generate power.

But guess what, someone destroyed the fuel pipes! Fuel starts leaking! Because of the leaking of fuel, we're running out of power.

Game idea inspired by a roblox game called "[Pinewood Computer Core](https://www.roblox.com/games/17541193/Pinewood-Computer-Core#!/game-instances)" by [Tokaisho](https://www.roblox.com/users/390939/profile/). I highly recommend you to play that game!

## How to play the game
### 1. Power generation
* You have two generators
* Each generator cost 10 units of fuel per second, then generates 5 units of power per second.
* So we're talking about (10*2)/2 = 20/2 = ***10 units of power per second***
* Each generator has its own fuel supply and coolant supply
* Fuel supply is infinite, it supply ***12 units of fuel per second*** if it isn't damaged
* If the pipe broke, it only supply ***2 units of fuel per second***
* In this case, the generators only produces ***total 2 units of power per second***
* But fuel supplies costs power to transport fuel, two fuel supplies will cost a total of ***4 units of power per second***
* Same as cooland supplies. So they will cost a total of ***8 units of power per second***

### 2. Temperature control
* The temperature of a generator increase ***5°C per second***
* The coolant supply decrease ***6°C per second***
* If the pipe broke, it decrease only ***1°C per second***
* If the temperature hit ***-4000°C or below***, a freezedown will happen and lead to a G.O.(Game Over)
* If the temperature hit ***4000°C or above***, a meltdown happens instead. And lead to another G.O.
* So you need to turn on/off the coolant to keep the temperature stable.

### 3. Something else
* Please remember it will take ***30 ~ 45 seconds*** to turn on/off a coolant/fuel supply. So you may need to turn off coolant once the temperature hit 3500, or turn on coolant once the temperature hit -3500
* Fixing a pipe also takes 30 ~ 45 seconds.
* It have a secret ending, find it out yourself.
